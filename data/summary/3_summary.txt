      As guns rise to leading cause of death among US children, research funding to help prevent and protect victims lags
    

Despite firearms being the leading cause of death among children in the US, federal funding for studying pediatric firearm mortality is minimal.

Recent increases in funding have led to more research in the area, aiming to reduce the number of deaths.

However, challenges persist, including outdated legislation and perceptions around firearm violence.

Continued and increased funding is necessary to make further progress in preventing firearm-related deaths among children.

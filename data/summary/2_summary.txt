      ‘It’s a new era’: Weight-loss treatments significantly lower blood pressure, studies find
    

Two new studies show that weight-loss treatments like weekly injections of tirzepatide and bariatric surgery can significantly reduce blood pressure in adults.

These findings suggest that effective obesity treatments may be key to improving heart health.

The research highlights the potential benefits of anti-obesity medications and surgery in treating conditions like hypertension.

However, barriers such as cost and insurance coverage may prevent some individuals from accessing these treatments, potentially exacerbating health disparities in the US.

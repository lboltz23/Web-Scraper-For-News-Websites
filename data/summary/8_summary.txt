      FDA approves new drug that may help stop a rare, fatal condition that doctors call a ‘ticking time bomb’
    

Katrina Barry was diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and given only a few years to live.

An experimental drug called sotatercept provided her with a potential lifeline.

After participating in a study and starting treatment, Barry's condition improved significantly.

The drug, now approved by the FDA and sold under the brand name Winrevair, offers hope to patients with PAH.

Despite some potential side effects, the drug has the potential to be a game-changer in treating the disease.

      Mpox cases in the US are on the rise as vaccination rates lag and new threats loom
    

Mpox cases in the United States have doubled from last year, with 511 cases reported this year compared to fewer than 300 at the same time in 2023.

Experts are urging improved vaccination coverage as transmission rates rise.

The vaccine is effective against mpox, but vaccination rates remain low.

Efforts to reach at-risk populations will be critical in curbing the spread of the virus, with vaccination being the most sustainable measure for prevention.

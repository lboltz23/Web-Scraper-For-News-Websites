      FDA settles lawsuit over ivermectin content that doctors claimed harmed their practice
    

The US Food and Drug Administration settled a lawsuit regarding its posts about ivermectin, including a popular social media campaign discouraging its use for Covid-19.

The FDA reiterated that ivermectin has not been shown to be effective against Covid-19.

Some doctors who recommended ivermectin for Covid treatment faced professional consequences, leading to the lawsuit.

The FDA agreed to remove and archive the posts in question in the settlement.

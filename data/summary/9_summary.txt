      CDC alerts doctors to watch for rare, serious bacterial infection appearing with unusual symptoms
    

Health officials are warning doctors to watch for an increase in rare, serious meningococcal infections in the US.

These infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis bacteria are unusual as they primarily affect middle-aged adults with higher fatality rates.

Symptoms may vary and can quickly become life-threatening.

The CDC recommends immediate treatment with antibiotics and encourages vaccination, especially for vulnerable groups.

The number of reported cases is on the rise in 2024.

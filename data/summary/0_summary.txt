      �A false sense of security�: Experts say delta-8 THC products can still be dangerous
    

The use of delta-8 products, marketed as a milder form of THC, has led to an increase in poison center calls due to adverse effects.

The FDA has issued warnings about the potential risks of delta-8, which is inconsistently labeled and may have varying doses.

Despite calls for regulation, the products remain popular, especially in states without legal access to cannabis.

Until regulations are implemented, experts recommend purchasing from reputable sources to ensure safety.

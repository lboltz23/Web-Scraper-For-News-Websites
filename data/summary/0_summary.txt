      ‘A false sense of security’: Experts say delta-8 THC products can still be dangerous
    

The article discusses the increasing popularity of delta-8 THC products, marketed as a milder alternative to traditional weed products.

However, despite being perceived as less potent, delta-8 can still be dangerous, leading to an 82% spike in calls to Poison Centers from 2021 to 2022.

The products lack regulation and consistency in labeling, posing risks for users, especially children.

Some states have banned delta-8, but efforts for stricter regulation are ongoing.

Experts recommend acquiring these products from reputable sources to ensure safety.

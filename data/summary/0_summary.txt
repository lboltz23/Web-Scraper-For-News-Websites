      ‘A false sense of security’: Experts say delta-8 THC products can still be dangerous
    

Delta-8 products, sometimes called "diet weed" or "light THC," have led to an increase in calls to poison centers, with many users experiencing adverse effects.

These products contain a milder form of THC, but the potency can still be dangerous.

The FDA issued a warning about the risks associated with delta-8, highlighting the need for regulation and caution when using such products.

It is advised to purchase delta-8 from reputable sources and be aware of the potential risks involved.

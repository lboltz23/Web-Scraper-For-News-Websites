      ‘A false sense of security’: Experts say delta-8 THC products can still be dangerous
    

Calls to poison centers about delta-8 products have increased significantly, with over 3,000 exposures in 2022.

While marketed as a milder alternative to traditional weed, these products can still be dangerous, with adverse effects including hallucinations and loss of consciousness.

The FDA has issued warnings, and experts urge consumers to purchase from reputable sources and be cautious due to inconsistent dosing and labeling.

Despite regulation efforts, the popularity of delta-8 and other cannabis compound products continues to rise.

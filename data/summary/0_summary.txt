      ‘A false sense of security’: Experts say delta-8 THC products can still be dangerous
    

Despite being marketed as a milder form of THC, delta-8 products have led to a rise in calls to poison centers due to adverse reactions.

The compound is not regulated like other pharmaceuticals, leading to inconsistent dosages and labeling.

Some products are appealing to children and may have high doses of THC.

As more states consider restrictions, experts advise purchasing from reputable sources.

Until regulations are in place, poison centers will likely continue to receive calls about delta-8.

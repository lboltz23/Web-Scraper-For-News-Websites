Despite the perceived mild effects, adverse reactions like hallucinations and anxiety are common.

Inconsistencies in product ingredients, labeling, and potency make it risky, especially for kids.

Legalities vary by state, and regulation efforts are ongoing.

Experts recommend buying from reputable sources and urge caution with these products due to potential dangers.

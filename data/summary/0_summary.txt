Delta-8 products, marketed as "diet weed" or "light THC," have seen an 82% spike in poison center calls, with thousands of exposures managed.

While touted as milder than traditional weed, delta-8 can still pose dangers, including adverse effects like hallucinations and hospitalization.

Lack of regulation and inconsistent labeling contribute to the risks associated with these products, prompting experts to urge caution and to purchase from reputable sources for safety.

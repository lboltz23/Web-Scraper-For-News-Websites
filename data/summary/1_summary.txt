      Respiratory virus season in the US isn’t over yet
    

Flu activity in the United States is on the rise again, with an 8% increase in emergency department visits resulting in over 82,000 flu diagnoses during the week ending January 27.

Experts warn that it's hard to predict the severity or duration of the flu season but note that Covid-19 and RSV levels remain high as well.

Despite the high burden of respiratory diseases, vaccines are showing strong protection and it's not too late to get vaccinated.

Local trends are the best indicator of risk.

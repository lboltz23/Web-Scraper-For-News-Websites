      Hereï¿½s how long it takes for your body to recover from food poisoning
    

A person experiences severe food poisoning after consuming a contaminated burger, resulting in a prolonged recovery process.

Foodborne illness is caused by bacteria or viruses thriving in the danger zone of temperatures.

Recovery from food poisoning involves staying hydrated, avoiding solid foods, and consuming bland, easily digestible options like the BRAT diet.

Severe cases may require medical attention, especially for older adults and those with weakened immune systems.

If symptoms persist or worsen, immediate medical attention is necessary.

      As guns rise to leading cause of death among US children, research funding to help prevent and protect victims lags
    

Federal funding for research on pediatric firearm deaths in the United States is inadequate, with only $12 million allocated per year from 2008 to 2017.

By 2020, firearm deaths surpassed car crashes as the leading cause of death among children.

Despite recent increases in funding, the issue remains vastly underfunded.

Researchers hope that more funding will allow for progress in understanding and preventing firearm injuries and deaths while destigmatizing research in this area.

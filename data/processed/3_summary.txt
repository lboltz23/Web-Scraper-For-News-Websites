      As guns rise to leading cause of death among US children, research funding to help prevent and protect victims lags
    

Federal funding for research into pediatric firearm mortality in the United States is limited, with only about $12 million awarded each year.

This is significantly less than funding for research into other leading causes of death among children.

Despite record levels of gun deaths in 2020, funding has not proportionally increased.

While there has been a recent bump in funding, it is still insufficient compared to the magnitude of the problem.

Researchers emphasize the importance of continued and increased funding to make progress in preventing firearm injuries and deaths.

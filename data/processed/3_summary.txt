      As guns rise to leading cause of death among US children, research funding to help prevent and protect victims lags
    

Federal funding for pediatric firearm mortality research is disproportionately low compared to other leading causes of death among children in the US.

Despite an increase in funding since 2020, challenges remain in studying and preventing gun-related deaths due to past legislative restrictions and stigma.

Researchers are hopeful that increased funding will lead to more impactful studies and ultimately help reduce firearm injuries and deaths among children.

      FDA approves new drug that may help stop a rare, fatal condition that doctors call a ‘ticking time bomb’
    

Katrina Barry was diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at 25 and given two to five years to live.

She participated in an experimental drug trial for sotatercept, which eventually led to FDA approval under the name Winrevair.

The drug, designed to treat PAH, showed promising results in clinical trials, allowing patients to walk farther and potentially improve over time.

Despite potential side effects, the drug offers hope for those with PAH.

      FDA approves new drug that may help stop a rare, fatal condition that doctors call a ‘ticking time bomb’
    

Katrina Barry was diagnosed with a rare and serious condition, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), giving her only a few years to live.

However, she enrolled in an experimental drug trial for sotatercept and experienced significant improvement in her condition.

This drug, now approved by the FDA and marketed as Winrevair, has shown promising results in treating PAH by potentially reversing the effects of the disease.

Barry's success story offers hope to others with PAH.

The U.

S.

CDC is warning doctors about a rise in rare, serious meningococcal infections caused by a certain strain of bacteria.

Cases are impacting middle-aged adults, rather than the typical age groups, and have a higher fatality rate.

Symptoms may be unusual, making diagnosis difficult.

The CDC is urging immediate treatment with antibiotics to prevent life-threatening outcomes.

A vaccine is available for protection, especially for vulnerable groups.

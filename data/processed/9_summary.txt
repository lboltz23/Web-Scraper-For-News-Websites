      CDC alerts doctors to watch for rare, serious bacterial infection appearing with unusual symptoms
    

Health officials are warning doctors about an increase in rare, serious meningococcal infections in the United States caused by Neisseria meningitidis bacteria, with a higher fatality rate than usual.

These cases are affecting middle-aged adults, a demographic not typically impacted.

Symptoms may be unusual and severe, with some patients not showing typical signs of meningitis infections.

The CDC recommends immediate treatment with antibiotics and highlights the importance of vaccination for prevention, especially for vulnerable populations.

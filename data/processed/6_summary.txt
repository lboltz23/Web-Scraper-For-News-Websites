      Takeaways from the Supreme Court arguments over the abortion drug mifepristone
    

The Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism about a nationwide ban on mifepristone, the primary drug for medication abortions.

The case revolves around FDA decisions to ease access to the drug and the standing of the doctors who challenged the FDA.

Justices questioned whether limiting access to mifepristone was necessary and raised concerns about the impact of a nationwide injunction.

The decision is expected in July.

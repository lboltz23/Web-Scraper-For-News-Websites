      Takeaways from the Supreme Court arguments over the abortion drug mifepristone
    

The Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism about a nationwide ban or new limits on mifepristone, the primary drug used for medication abortions.

The case questioned lower court rulings that rolled back FDA decisions to ease access to mifepristone.

Justices questioned the standing of the doctors challenging the FDA, raised concerns about access to the drug, and debated the impact of universal injunctions.

A decision is expected by July.

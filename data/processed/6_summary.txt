      Takeaways from the Supreme Court arguments over the abortion drug mifepristone
    

The Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical of a nationwide ban on the abortion pill, mifepristone, during a recent hearing.

The case involves lower court rulings that rolled back FDA decisions to ease access to the drug.

Questions arose about the doctors' ability to challenge the FDA and concerns about limiting access to mifepristone.

The decision is expected by July, with justices expressing doubt about the need for new restrictions on the drug.

      ‘A false sense of security’: Experts say delta-8 THC products can still be dangerous
    

Delta-8 products, marketed as milder alternatives to traditional cannabis, have led to an increase in calls to poison centers due to adverse effects.

While delta-8 is less potent than delta-9 THC, it can still cause dangerous reactions.

The FDA has issued warnings, and regulation of these products varies by state.

To ensure safety, experts recommend purchasing from reputable sources and checking for testing results on the labels.

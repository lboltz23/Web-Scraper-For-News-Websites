      ‘A false sense of security’: Experts say delta-8 THC products can still be dangerous
    

The use of delta-8 cannabis products, marketed as a milder alternative to traditional weed, has resulted in an increase in calls to Poison Centers due to adverse effects such as hallucinations and confusion.

Despite being touted as less potent, the contents and dosages of delta-8 products are inconsistent and labels may be misleading.

Lack of regulation and oversight has led to safety concerns, especially for children who may inadvertently ingest these products.

Regulatory efforts are being made to address the issue, but until then, experts advise purchasing from reputable sources to ensure safety.

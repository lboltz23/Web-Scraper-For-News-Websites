      ‘A false sense of security’: Experts say delta-8 THC products can still be dangerous
    

Calls to poison centers regarding delta-8 products have increased, with 3,358 exposures managed in 2022.

Despite claims of being "diet weed," delta-8 can still have dangerous effects, resulting in adverse events such as hallucinations and loss of consciousness.

The FDA has warned about the risks of these products, and their inconsistent labeling and potency make them particularly concerning.

Experts recommend purchasing delta-8 products from reputable sources.

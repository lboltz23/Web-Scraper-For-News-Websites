      ‘A false sense of security’: Experts say delta-8 THC products can still be dangerous
    

The popularity of delta-8 products, marketed as a milder form of THC, has led to an increase in calls to Poison Centers in the US.

Despite claims that delta-8 offers a less intense high, adverse effects can still occur, including hospitalizations.

Inconsistencies in labeling and dosing make these products potentially dangerous, especially for children.

Public health experts urge caution and recommend purchasing from reputable sources to prevent harm.

Regulatory efforts are underway to address safety concerns.

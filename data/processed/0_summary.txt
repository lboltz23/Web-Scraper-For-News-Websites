      ‘A false sense of security’: Experts say delta-8 THC products can still be dangerous
    

Delta-8 products, marketed as "diet weed" or "light THC," are causing an increase in calls to poison centers due to adverse effects.

These products, made with a milder cannabis compound, are inconsistently labeled and may have dangerous side effects.

While popular, these products are unregulated and pose risks to users, especially children.

Dr.

Kait Brown urges consumers to purchase these products from reputable sources and store them safely.

Regulatory efforts are underway to address the issue, but until then, caution is advised.

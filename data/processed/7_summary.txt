The FDA settled a lawsuit over misleading posts about the use of ivermectin to treat Covid-19, including a popular social media campaign.

Conservative outlets touted the drug as effective against Covid, but the FDA warned against its use.

Several doctors filed the lawsuit claiming the FDA overstepped its authority.

The FDA agreed to remove the posts and settle the lawsuit, emphasizing that ivermectin is not approved for use against Covid-19.

The US FDA settled a lawsuit over its posts about ivermectin, a drug used for animals and humans, which some claimed was effective against Covid.

The agency disagreed, stating there is no clinical trial data supporting its effectiveness.

The lawsuit claimed the FDA interfered with the ability of doctors to prescribe ivermectin.

The settlement includes the removal of social media posts and other materials related to ivermectin from the FDA's website.

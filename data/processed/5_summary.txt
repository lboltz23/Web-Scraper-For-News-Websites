      Mpox cases in the US are on the rise as vaccination rates lag and new threats loom
    

Mpox cases in the US have doubled compared to last year, raising transmission risks and highlighting the need for improved vaccination coverage.

With potential for outbreaks due to low vaccination rates, experts stress the importance of getting at-risk populations vaccinated.

Mpox is less severe than smallpox but can be dangerous for those with HIV.

Efforts to prevent spread include targeted outreach to high-risk populations and ensuring vaccine access, as treatment remains a challenge in the sexual health field.

      Mpox cases in the US are on the rise as vaccination rates lag and new threats loom
    

Cases of Mpox in the United States have doubled compared to last year, with 511 cases reported so far this year.

Experts are emphasizing the need to improve vaccination coverage to prevent further transmission.

Although transmission rates are still lower than in 2022, the country remains vulnerable to outbreaks due to low vaccination rates.

Efforts are being made to reach at-risk populations and increase access to vaccinations, as prevention is key to curbing the spread of the virus.

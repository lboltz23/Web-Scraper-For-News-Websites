      Mpox cases in the US are on the rise as vaccination rates lag and new threats loom
    

Mpox cases in the US have doubled from last year, emphasizing the need for increased vaccination coverage.

Federal resources for public health are limited, leaving the country vulnerable to outbreaks.

Men who have sex with men and those with HIV face higher risks, and vaccination rates remain low.

Efforts are being made to reach at-risk populations and expand access to vaccines, but challenges in treatment access persist.

Public health officials stress the importance of prevention through vaccination to curb the spread of the virus.

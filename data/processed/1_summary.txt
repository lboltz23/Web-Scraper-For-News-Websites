      Respiratory virus season in the US isn’t over yet
    

After a few weeks of decline, flu activity is on the rise again in the United States, with over 82,000 people being diagnosed with the flu in emergency departments.

Although a second surge of flu activity is common, it is difficult to predict how severe the season will be.

Covid-19 and RSV are also circulating at high levels, with 18 states experiencing high levels of respiratory illness.

Getting vaccinated and practicing good hygiene are recommended to prevent spread of illness.

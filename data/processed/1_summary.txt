      Respiratory virus season in the US isnï¿½t over yet
    

Flu activity is starting to rise again in the United States, with over 82,000 people visiting emergency departments with influenza during the week ending January 27.

Experts say a second surge of flu activity is common after the holidays, and it's too early to predict the severity of the rest of the season.

Covid-19 and RSV are also circulating at high levels, but overall trends are within expected ranges.

Vaccination and hygiene practices are encouraged to prevent spread.

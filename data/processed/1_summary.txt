      Respiratory virus season in the US isn’t over yet
    

Flu activity is on the rise again in the United States, with more than 82,000 people diagnosed with influenza in emergency departments during the week ending January 27.

Covid-19 and RSV levels remain high as well.

Experts say it's difficult to predict the full season's trajectory, but the second wave of flu activity is expected after the winter holidays.

Overall, the US has experienced high levels of respiratory illnesses with millions of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

The Covid-19 vaccine and flu shot offer strong protection, and practicing proper hygiene is important.

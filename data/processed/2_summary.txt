      ‘It’s a new era’: Weight-loss treatments significantly lower blood pressure, studies find
    

Two studies showed significant reductions in blood pressure in adults who underwent weight-loss treatments.

One study found that tirzepatide injections lowered blood pressure, while the other showed improved blood pressure control in those who underwent bariatric surgery.

The research suggests that effective obesity treatment is key to heart health.

Experts believe novel weight-loss medications like tirzepatide could have profound benefits, but barriers like costs and insurance coverage may prevent widespread access.
